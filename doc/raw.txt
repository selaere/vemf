:title: About
if you are reading this, you are reading the vemf documentation. the vemf documentation has information about all of the different characters, verbs, nouns and adverbs that vemf has.
this documentation can be enjoyed in a ||"raw" text format@https://github.com/selaere/vemf/blob/main/doc/raw.txt|| or in a ||nice html webpage format@https://selaere.github.io/vemf/doc/docs.html||. the raw format is converted to html with ||a vemf script@https://github.com/selaere/vemf/blob/main/doc/gen.vemf||.
but not only does this documentation have text. in fact i am bad at explaining stuff, so there are way more examples than text. here's one!
> "hello world i am a vemf test"\"aeiou" ≡ "hll wrld  m  vmf tst"
the vemf documentation is not only a documentation, it doubles as a test suite! when the tests are run, the expressions to both sides of the ` ≡ ` are evaluated, and checked for equality. if you see an example like this:
> 1+1 ≡ 2
you know it will work in the latest vemf version!
the main way to play around with vemf is the interactive repl.
>     1+1
> 2
>     __*3
> 6
the indented lines are input, and the result is unindented and ||formatted@#Format|| automatically. the default formatting is not always what you want though:
>     "hello world i am a vemf test"\"aeiou"
> (104 108 108 32 119 114 108 100 32 32 109 32 32 118 109 102 32 116 115 116)
in the repl, you can format it into a string by using `)4 ` (see ||Format||)
>     )4 "hello world i am a vemf test"\"aeiou"
> "hll wrld  m  vmf tst"
if you evaluate something like "tangent of pi radians", thanks to floating-point shenanigans, you can get small inaccuracies:
>     πâ
> -0.00000000000000012246467991473532
when testing those we use ` ± ` ||Approximate Equal||, and if a test passes, the results are within about 10 significant figures.
> πâ ± 0
not everything can be automatically tested. functions that rely on the random number generator, like `áàå`, won't give the same results everytime, so tests with `?≡` are ignored.
> 5á ?≡ 3

:title: Basics
here's a vemf expression!
> 1+2 ≡ 3
surprising! vemf can do maths. there are more operations, of course,
> 3*2 ≡ 6
> 8/4 ≡ 2
> 2*3+1 ≡ 7
characters like `+ - * /` are functions. here they take two arguments at each side: `α+β`.
evaluation of functions is strictly left to right:
> 1+2*3 ≡ 9
functions may also be called with one argument (monadic) instead of two (dyadic), by only giving the left argument `α+`. here you can see `-` being called as `α-` ||Negate|| and `α-β` ||Subtract||:
> 3-1 ≡ 2
> 4+2- ≡ _6
> 4+2-- ≡ 6
> 5- ≡ _5
> 5--3 ≡ _8
, where `_5`, `_6`, `_8` are constants meaning −5, −6, −8 respectively.
almost every function has two different variants that do different things. even `+`! monadic `α+` ||Sum|| adds all the items in a list:
> 123+ ≡ 6
uh, hm. yes. this is not the number one hundred and twenty-three. consecutive values form a list, and `1`, `2`, `3` are values. the sum of all of those is 6.
if you do want the number 123, you can use ||Numeric Literal||s by prepending a `:` colon:
> :123+1 ≡ :124
> :12:33:-4+ ≡ :41
or even shorter (and more obscure), we can use a ||Character Literal|| with a backtick. `z` is the 123rd character in ||the codepage@#The Codepage||, so:
> `z+1 ≡ :123
note that whitespace matters when using numeric literals:
> :12 34+ ≡ :19
> :123 4+ ≡ :127
you may use parentheses to group expressions:
> 1+(2*3) ≡ 7
here, `2*3` is another expression that is executed before the outer one, and `(2*3)` is a single value.
the mathematical operations you are familiar with are here. arithmetic `+-*/`, `^` ||Exponent||, `∟` ||Logarithm||, and a bunch more.

:title: Lists
a list is a finite ordered collection of values. lists can be created with stranding syntax, which just means putting values next to each other:
>     123
> (1 2 3)
>     :16:25:36:49:64
> (16 25 36 49 64)
lists may be nested arbitrarily deep. this is a list composed of 3 lists, each with 3 items (or, if you prefer, a 3 by 3 matrix).
>     (123)(456)(789)
> ((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9))
the arguments of a list dont have to have the same length or the same type:
>     (036)9 
> ((0 3 6) 9)
>     (98)(123)(4567)
> ((9 8) (1 2 3) (4 5 6 7))
we can get a list's length with `α~`:
> 123~ ≡ 3
in vemf, strings are lists of characters (rather, Unicode codepoints). a string literal makes a list with all the characters inside the ||Quotes||, in vemf's codepage:
> "abc" ≡ :97:98:99
> "♥♦♣♠" ≡ 3456
> "Hello, World!"~ ≡ :13
strings can be stranded as well:
>     "earth""fire""air""water"
> ((101 97 114 116 104) (102 105 114 101) (97 105 114) (119 97 116 101 114))
>     )4 "earth""fire""air""water"
> ("earth" "fire" "air" "water")
functions that work with numbers are scalar functions: they automatically distribute to every number in a list. for two lists, this pairs up the elements and operates on them:
> 012*345 ≡ 0 4 :10
if one argument is a list and another is a scalar, the scalar is 'distributed' to all the items in the array:
> 63102+2 ≡ 85324
> 1/234 ≡ (1/2)(1/3)(1/4)
these rules are applied recursively:
> (123)(456)(789)+01(323) ≡ (123)(567)(:10:10:12)
see also: ||Each||, ||Conform||
comparison functions, like `< = > ≤ ~ ≥` (`α~β` is ||Not Equals||), are scalar as well, and they return a 1 if true, otherwise 0:
> "cat"="cow" ≡ 100
> "cat"="cat" ≡ 111
> (0123)(456)(78)9>5 ≡ (0000)(001)(11)1
> "pickled peppers"~`p ≡ 011111110100111
though it's useful to compare if two lists are equal, so there is also `≡` ||Matches|| and `≈` ||Not Matches||
> "cat"≡"cow" ≡ 0
> "cat"≡"cat" ≡ 1
we've seen that characters are not a separate type, and they are just their codepoints. subtracting an ascii lowercase letter by 32 makes it uppercase, so we can make a word uppercase by:
> "screaming"-:32 ≡ "SCREAMING"
though there's also another function for this, `Ç` ||Uppercase||, and it leaves punctuation unchanged:
> "words words"Ç ≡ "WORDS WORDS"
an element in a list can be indexed with `α@β` ||Index||, where indices start with 0:
> 2468@2 ≡ 6
> 2468@0 ≡ 2
> 2468@ ≡ 2 ' monadic @ is First
> (123)(456)(789)@2 ≡ 789
> (123)(456)(789)@21 ≡ 8
`α,β` ||Concatenate||s lists:
> 123,456 ≡ 123456
> 1,234 ≡ 1234
> (12)(34),56 ≡ (12)(34)56
and `α♫β` creates a ||Pair||:
> 123♫456 ≡ (123)(456)
`α↕` ||Iota|| returns all the integers from 0 up to α:
> 5↕ ≡ 01234
if you want something more familiar, try `α↨` ||Inclusive Iota||:
> 5↨ ≡ 12345
all lists have a fill, usually `■` ||None||. you can think of the fill as a dummy element for the elements outside of its domain. when you index out of range, you will get the fill:
> 123@3 ≡ ■
the default fill is ||None||. you can specify the fill of a list `α▐β` ||Set Fill||, and query it with `α▐` ||Get Fill||.
> 123▐0@3 ≡ 0
> 123▐ ≡ ■
> 123▐0▐ ≡ 0
`α↑β` ||Take|| takes the first β items, and `α♂β` ||Drop|| returns everything but the first β items:
> "javascript"↑4 ≡ "java"
> "javascript"♂4 ≡ "script"
`↓` ||Take Right|| and `♀` ||Drop Right|| use the last items instead:
> "file.txt"↓4 ≡ ".txt"
> "file.txt"♀4 ≡ "file"
these use the fill when the list runs out:
> "js"▐` ↑5 ≡ "js   "
> "js"▐` ↓5 ≡ "   js"
but `α¶β` ||Reshape|| starts taking from the start when it runs out of items:
> 123¶9 ≡ 123123123
> "sal"¶5 ≡ "salsa"
`↑`, `↓` and `¶` with a list as a right argument can reshape, or create a nested list with those dimensions:
> 0123456789↑33 ≡ (012)(345)(678)
> 0123456789↓33 ≡ (123)(456)(789)
> 1234¶43 ≡ (123)(412)(341)(234)

:title: Adverbs
adverbs are a syntax for functions that take other functions. take one of the most basic: ||Selfie|| `┴G` takes a function `G` and returns a function that applies `G` with the same argument used twice:
> 123┴+ ≡ 246
> 123┴* ≡ 149
> "bee"┴, ≡ "beebee"
> "bee"┴♫ ≡ "bee""bee"
and if ||Swap|| `┴G` is called with two arguments, it returns a functions that applies `G` with its arguments flipped:
> 6┴-2 ≡ _4
> 4┴/1 ≡ 1/4  ' reciprocal
there are two types of adverbs. 1-adverbs, like `┴G` ||Selfie||/||Swap||, take one operand after them, and the whole acts as a verb. 2-adverbs, like `F║G` ||Over||, take two operands at both sides. Over applies `G` to each argument, and then `F`:
> 4²║+5 ≡ 4²+(5²)
> 4²║▲ ≡ 4²▲
adverb precedence is right-to-left.
> 4┴²║-5 ≡ 5²-(4²)
additionally, 1-adverbs can be used before 2-adverbs, and this applies them to the left operand:
> 4*┴║-5 ≡ 4(┴*)║-5
> 4*┴║-5 ≡ 4*4-(5*5)
the built-in adverbs are all box-drawing symbols (though not all box-drawing symbols are adverbs). 1-adverbs have a single vertical line and 2-adverbs have a double vertical lines:
> 1-adverbs: ╪┼┴┬╧╤╕╒╛╘┐┌
> 2-adverbs: ╬╫╨╥╩╦╖╓╜╙╗╔║
these adverbs have a variety of uses. some of them are ||Combinators||, like the ones that we've just seen, and they apply the operands in various ways. some are more interesting, though.
# Iteration
vemf automatically vectorizes, so often explicit loops are usually not necessary. however, some adverbs can be used to explicitly iterate in a certain way
`α╕G` ||Each|| applies G to every item in α:
> (123)(45)(6789)"aaaaaa"╕~ ≡ 3246
`α╕Gβ` ||Each|| (dyadic) pairs the items up and applies G to each pair:
> 123╕,456 ≡ (14)(25)(36)
`α╛Gβ` ||Each Left|| and `α╘Gβ` ||Each Right|| iterate through one argument, while passing the other argument:
> 123╛,456 ≡ (1456)(2456)(3456)
> 123╘,456 ≡ (1234)(1235)(1236)
using both Each Left and Each Right we get something similar to APL's outer product, or a cartesian product:
> 123╘╛,456 ≡ ((14)(24)(34))((15)(25)(35))((16)(26)(36))
> 123╛╘,456 ≡ ((14)(15)(16))((24)(25)(26))((34)(35)(36))
`α╧G` ||Reduce|| is like applying G between every element in α, progressively building up a value: 
> 2345╧+ ≡ 2+3+4+5
this is similar to the monadic use of addition, `α+` ||Sum||. in fact, `*` `,` `&` `&#x7c;` `ñ` `Ñ` all act the same way: the monad is the reduction of the dyad.
`α╤G` ||Scan|| gives the intermediate results of the reduction:
> 2345╤+ ≡ (2)(2+3)(2+3+4)(2+3+4+5)
> 00100010011020╤+ ≡ 00111122234466
`αF╨G` ||Power|| calls G, `αF` times
> 14╨┴♫ ≡ ( ((11)(11)) ((11)(11)) )( ((11)(11)) ((11)(11)) )
(note that `14` is not a strand, `4` is an operand of the 2-adverb, and `1` is an argument)
`αF╩G` ||Until|| calls G until `αF` returns not 0.
# Combinators
combinators call their operands in different ways. they are one of the main ways functions are defined; combinators are the "glue" that joins different functions.
vemf has a lot of different combinators! here's a summary, using `+` `/` `*` as examples:
> NAME         : MONADIC, DYADIC
> atop      +/ : α+/    , α+β/
> swap      ┴/ : α/α    , β/α
> atleft   +╜/ : α+/    , α+/β
> atright  +╙/ : α/     , α/(β+)
> over     +║/ : α+/    , α+/(β+)
> onleft   +╖/ : α+/α   , α+β/β
> onright  +╓/ : α/(α+) , α/(α+β)
> fork    └+/* : α+/(α*), α+β/(α*β)
there is also a ""3-adverb"" of sorts, the `└FGH` ||Fork||. it works a little differently, it is a prefix rather than an infix, and is ocassionally useful. for instance, the average (mean) of a list is the sum divided by the length:
> 12345└+/~ ≡ 3
the formula for triangular numbers is n(n+1)/2. we can do the first part as a fork:
> 6└◄*▲ ≡ :42
this is the same as
> 6◄*(6▲) ≡ :42
here, `◄` is the identity function or ||Left||, that always returns the left argument. there is also a `►` ||Right||, that returns the right argument.
> 6◄3 ≡ 6
> 6►3 ≡ 3
> 6*(6▲) ≡ :42
and then we can do the halving with `½` ||Half||:
> 6└◄*▲½ ≡ :21
as a general rule of thumb, when there is a `◄` or `►` in a fork, it can be represented with one of the other combinators. here we can use `αF╓G` ||On Right||, which evaluates to `αG(αF)`
> 6▲╓*½ ≡ :21
here is another way of representing all the combinators that i can test automatically
> ♫,;`(,`)→F ♫,;`[,`]→G ♫,;`{,`}→H ≡ ■
> (`a┴G)   (`a┴G`b)    ≡ "[aa]"    "[ba]"
> (`aF╜G)  (`aF╜G`b)   ≡ "[(a)]"   "[(a)b]"
> (`aF╙G)  (`aF╙G`b)   ≡ "[a]"     "[a(b)]"
> (`aF╖G)  (`aF╖G`b)   ≡ "[(a)a]"  "[(ab)b]"
> (`aF╓G)  (`aF╓G`b)   ≡ "[a(a)]"  "[a(ab)]"
> (`aF║G)  (`aF║G`b)   ≡ "[(a)]"   "[(a)(b)]"
> (`a└FGH) (`a└FGH`b)  ≡ "[(a){a}]""[(ab){ab}]"
> (`aF╜H╙G)(`aF╜H╙G`b) ≡ "[(a)]"   "[(a){b}]"

:title: Variables
i will now introduce some terminology. functions, lists and numbers are types of values. in a program, these types can all be used as either nouns or verbs (what we've been calling "values" and "functions" up to now). a function may be used as a noun, and a verb may be used as a function.
a noun can become a verb if you enclose it in parentheses. this way, you can pass functions to other functions. `α$β` ||Call||s α with the pair of arguments β:
> (*)$35 ≡ :15
with built-in functions, you can also use a dot `.` before the name:
> .*$35 ≡ :15
you can also have functions in lists:
> .+.-.*./@3$62 ≡ 3
indexing a function calls it monadically with the index,
> .-@3 ≡ _3
and some list functions, like ||Take||, use this to treat functions as infinite lists:
> .◄↑4 ≡ 0123
> .-↑33 ≡ (0_1_2)(_3_4_5)(_6_7_8)
> .+~ ≡ ∞
characters from `a` to `z` are variables, which are given somewhat-convenient default values.
> abcdefghij ≡ :12:20:99:100:999:1000:10000:100000:1000000:10000000
> klmnopqrst ≡ :15:16:31:32:63:64:127:128:255:256
> uvwxyz     ≡ :512:1024:32768:65536:16777216:2147483648
> f+n ≡ :1032
variables can be set with `→name` and retrieved as a noun with `.name`. the dot is not necessary for variables `a` to `z`.
> :35/7→f 1/f ≡ :0.2
> :35/7→five 1/.five ≡ :0.2
built-in verbs are also variables, and that's why you can get them with a dot. `.` is the noun variable prefix, and `:` is the verb variable prefix:
> 4:*3 ≡ :12
that was useless. but this means you can assign functions and use them as verbs!
> *→mult 4:mult3 ≡ :12
> └+/~→avg 234:avg ≡ 3
`A` to `Z` don't need the colon:
> *→M 4M3 ≡ :12
> └+/~→V 234:avg ≡ 3
calling a number or a list as a verb just makes it return itself:
> :35/7→f 4:f ≡ :5
> :35/7→F 4F  ≡ :5
a name, or identifier, can be a sequence of lowercase letters (`mul`, `six`, `things`), an underscore followed by a character (`_ë`, `_1`) or a single character (`+`, `-`). any other name can be used by using quotes: `."Name of variable"`
`x→name` is a statement that sets x to the variable `.name`. statements are not quite like verbs; you will see more about statements in the ||Statements|| section.
there is another kind of assignment: `─name` ||Set Function|| (that is a box drawing character, not a minus sign `-`). it is a verb that sets α to the variable and returns β or, if not given, α. this makes it flexible to define a variable and then use it.
> 4 ─four 1+2+.four ≡ 7  ' β is 1, return 1 after changing the variable
> 4 ─four +1+2      ≡ 7  ' β not given, return .four back
and for golfing purposes, the functions `A`..`Z` are set by default to `─a`..`─z`, so you can set and get variables conveniently.
> 3+1X+x ≡ 8
---
:title: Trains
we saw earlier that you can assign a verb to a variable with `→name`,
> +→add 4:add5 ≡ 9
and you can use a verb as a noun by enclosing it in parentheses (or, in general, having it at the start of an expression)
> (+)$12 ≡ 3
but by having more stuff inside the expression, we can modify the verb in certain ways:
a verb and a noun `Fβ` is called a Bind. it calls F with β as a right argument, ignoring whatever was passed to the right.
> +1→inc 4:inc ≡ 5
> (+1)@5 ≡ 6
> *2→dup 4:dup ≡ 8
> *2→dup 4:dup9 ≡ 8
(note that `inc` and `dup` are equivalent to `α▲` ||Bump Up|| and `α¼` ||Double||)
> +1→inc 4:inc ≡ 5
> *2→dup 4:dup ≡ 8
> *2→dup 4:dup9 ≡ 8
a verb and a verb `FG` is an Atop. it calls F with all arguments, and then calls G atop of that.
> ↨*→fact 6:fact ≡ :720
> ~↕→dom  "text":dom ≡ 0123
> |¬→nor  0:nor1 ≡ 0
(note that `fact`, `dom`, `nor` are equivalent to `α!` ||Factorial|| (for natural α), `α♣` ||Domain|| and `αöβ` ||Nor||)
verb+verb+noun `FGβ` is a mix of the two: it calls F with both arguments, and then calls G atop of that using β as a right argument.
> +/2→avg  4:avg8 ≡ 6
> ²*π→area 3:area ≡ 9*π
(note that `π` is pi, the number)
you can chain these, left-to-right
> +1+2+3→f 5:f ≡ :11
> ~=0→empty φ:empty ≡ 1
we've been setting these trains to variables before using them. it won't work if you try to apply them directly with parentheses:
> 5(+/2)9
is a list with `5`, the function `+/2` (as a noun) and `9`. you can turn a noun into a verb with ||Verbize|| `┘`:
> 5┘(+/2)9 ≡ 7
> 6┘(↨*) ≡ :720
but you never actually need to do this! an inlined train will always be shorter:
> 5+9/2 ≡ 7
> 6↨* ≡ :720
trains are also useful when used with adverbs:
> ' if length is 3, uppercase
> "and""the""small""bee""wanted""to""fly"╕(~=3)╨Ç ≡ "AND""THE""small""BEE""wanted""to""FLY"
we can create a variable from the triangular number function from earlier with a train.
the `½` is applied atop the result of the fork, so as a single function this is an atop:
> 6▲╓*½ ≡ :21
> 6┘(▲╓*½) ≡ :21
note that we need the `┘` for it to be interpreted as a function.
we can set our function to a variable and use it.
> ▲╓*½→triang 6:triang ≡ :21
this way of defining functions, stringing other functions together with combinators— is an important part of vemf. you might hear it being called "tacit programming" or "point-free style". note how we never refer to our arguments by name. we can also define this function explicitly (see ||Statements||):
> {α*(α▲)½}→triang 6:triang ≡ :21
> {α▲*α½}→triang 6:triang ≡ :21  ' multiplication is commutative
but the tacit form is simpler (and shorter, and somewhat faster).

:title: Groups
i don't like parentheses. i don't like the fact that occasionally i have to use them to make things work. i don't like that precedence is a thing. but alas, this is not a stack language, and we ocassionally need to group things. but parentheses take up a lot of space, and something as simple as `+2` gains two characters when used with an adverb `(+2)╜/`. 
> 7 (+2)╜/ 3
precedence adjusting is annoying:
> :42→a "I think ",(aª)," is a good number." ≡ "I think 42 is a good number."
nested list literals can also get unwieldy:
> (123)(45)(6789)
the solution is group characters. group characters act like parentheses, but instead of terminating when the closing parenthesis is found, how much will be grouped depends the character you use. here are all the groupers:
> 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
> │ ├ ╞ ╟ ╠ ┤ ╡ ╢ ╣
their basic function is grouping a number of nouns and verbs (or words) together. the number next to them specifies how many will be grouped. the 2-grouper `│` will group 2 words:
> │01│23│45 ≡ (01)(23)(45)
> │012││345│67 ≡ (01)2((34)5)(67)
> ├123│45╞6789 ≡ (123)(45)(6789)
> :42→a "I think ",│aª," is a good number." ≡ "I think 42 is a good number."
there's a pattern to these: when they're pointing to the right the number of lines going out is the number of words grouped, and the symbols for 7, 8, 9, 10 groupers are flipped 3, 4, 5, 6 groupers.
we said that groupers are alternatives to parentheses. in an expression, there are a few places where it makes sense to stop the expression, or to place a closing parenthesis. for example, for the expression `1+2+3`
> (1)+2+3
> (1+)2+3
> (1+2)+3
> (1+2+)3
> (1+2+3)
are all expressions that make sense. if you represent the places where the parentheses can end with spaces: `1 + 2 + 3`
all that groupers do is pick which space to close with:
> │1+2+3 ≡ (1 +)2 + 3
> ├1+2+3 ≡ (1 + 2)+ 3
> ╞1+2+3 ≡ (1 + 2 +)3
> ╟1+2+3 ≡ (1 + 2 + 3)
groupers won't break into literals, parentheses, other groupers, or any other nested structure. `1+(2/3)-:3.14` is split like `1 + (2/3) - :3.14 ²`:
> │1+(2/3)-:3.14² ≡ (1 +)(2/3) - :3.14 ²

a grouper can't break after an adverb, as adverbs always need a verb after them:
> │a╒+b ≡ (a╒+)b
> │a╕╕(♣♠)b ≡ (a╕╕(♣♠))b
but it can break before a 2-adverb! this is actually really useful to adjust adverb precedence, as doing `(-╖!)║*` is different to `-╖!║*`
> a -╖!║*b ≡ a - ╖! ║* b
> a│-╖!║*b ≡ a(- ╖!)║* b
groupers also can't break between the operands in a fork:
> φ └+╛+╕+║- ≡ φ └+╛+╕+ ║-
> φ┘└+╛+╕+║- ≡ φ(└+╛+╕+)║-
(`┘` ||Verbize|| is also a 1-grouper. this is occasionally useful)

:title: Statements
there is a more explicit way of defining functions, and it looks more like lambda expressions you might be used to from other languages:
> 456{α+/(α~)} ≡ 5
> 345{β^(α♣♠)*α+}:10 ≡ :345
that thing inside braces is the ||function definition@#Define Function||, and it uses special variables like `α` or `β` that are always defined inside dfns. the expression inside the braces will be evaluated and returned.
but there's more that you can do inside functions. dfns are composed of multiple statements, and the result of the last one is returned.
statements are delimited by statement separators like `·` ||Discard|| or `◘` ||Return||. discard statements evaluate a value and discard it; return statements return a value from the function.
> ■{1·2·3◘4·5} ≡ 3
not very interesting. you have already seen one statement separator: `→name` assigns the body of the statement to the variable with that name. you can use this in longer pieces of code, to give names to values.
> 456{α+→avg α~→len .avg/.len} ≡ 5
functions create a lexical scope. this means variables you define inside of a function will not be accessible outside.
these become more useful when used with `x?y` ||Then|| (note that Then is not a function), which executes the following statement `y` if `x` is not 0. you can use these for ternary-operator-like things:
> _5{α>0?α◘α-} ≡ 5
the left side of `?` can take a function, and it will be called with the same arguments as the outer function:
> _5{>0?α◘α-} ≡ 5
you can also use statements in ||Blocks||, that work like functions that are immediately evaluated. this can be useful for conditions:
> [1+1=2?"good"◘"bad"] ≡ "good"
or for doing multiple things if a condition holds. blocks don't create their own scope, so:
> 6{α→a 4→b a>b?[a-b→a 0→b]· ab} ≡ 20

this is based on the ||CP-437@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437|| codepage. this is the codepage used in the very first IBM PCs! note that
- `◙ 0A` doubles as a ||Line Break||, it is whitespace
- `  20` is a space
- `¨ F9` represents `¨ U+00A8 DIAERESIS`, while CP-437 uses a small middle dot. it is encoded in Unicode as `∙ U+2219 BULLET OPERATOR`, but most modern fonts don't make the distinction with `· FA` or `• F7`. (the related codepage ||CP-850@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_850|| does this too)
- `¤ 00` and `⎕ FF` are control characters in CP-437. they are assigned other characters in vemf (`¤ U+00A4 CURRENCY SIGN` and `⎕ U+2395 APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL QUAD` respectively) but (for now) they are syntax errors outside of literals
these are all of the symbols available to vemf programs. vemf files can be encoded in Unicode (UTF-8) or the vemf codepage byte-by-byte.
some confusable characters are translated to the codepage:
- U+2212 MINUS SIGN `−` and U+2013 EN DASH `–` to hyphens `-` (0x2D)
- U+23AE INTEGRAL EXTENSION `⎮` to box-drawing character `│` (0xB3)
- U+237A APL FUNCTIONAL SYMBOL ALPHA `⍺` to alpha `α` (0xE0)
- U+00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S `ß` to beta `β` (0xE1)
- U+2211 N-ARY SUMMATION `∑` to uppercase sigma `Σ` (0xE4)
- U+00B5 MICRO SIGN `µ` to mu `μ` (0xE6)
- U+2126 OHM SIGN `Ω` to uppercase omega `Ω` (0xEA)
- U+00F0 LATIN SMALL LETTER ETH `ð` to delta `δ` (0xEB)
- U+03D5 GREEK PHI SYMBOL `ϕ` and U+0278 LATIN SMALL LETTER PHI `ɸ` to phi (0xED)
- U+025B LATIN SMALL LETTER OPEN E `ɛ` to epsilon `ε` (0xEE)
- U+2219 BULLET OPERATOR `∙` to diaereses `¨` (0xF9)
- control characters 0x00-0x1F are converted literally
if a character is not in the codepage or in this list, it will be implicitly converted into a ||Unicode Escape||.
# Execution
a vemf file is a list of statements that are executed in order. there are only a few ways a vemf program can contact with the outside world
the command line arguments are available as `δ` ||Arguments||. as a shorthand, `α` ||Alpha|| and `β` ||Beta|| are set to the first argument and second argument respectively, and `Σ` ||Arity|| is the number of arguments. arguments are always Unicode strings.
the return value of the program (either from a `◘` ||Return|| in the top scope or the last statement in the program) is, by default, formatted and printed automatically. the formatting is the same as `ⁿ0` (see ||Format||):
- if the result is a function, it is called with the arguments passed into the program (monadically with α if only one argument was passed, otherwise with α and β), and then formatted
- if the result is a scalar, it is printed as a number in decimal
- if the result is a flat list, it is printed as a Unicode string, where every element is a codepoint
- if the result is a nested list, each of the inner lists will be printed as a separate line and delimited with newlines
there are also input and output streams. there can be any number, but the cli uses input stream 0 for stdin, output stream 0 for stdout, and output stream 1 for stderr. `☺` ||Print|| and `☻` ||Print Line|| always print text to output stream 0.
the streams are byte streams, and the functions `Ö` ||Write|| and `Ü` ||Read|| convert to/from UTF-8. you may use `_Ö` ||Write Bytes|| and `_Ü` ||Read Bytes|| to manipulate the byte streams directly.
you also have access to a global random number generator (see `á` ||Pick||, `â` ||Sample||, `å` ||Choice||)

if β is longer than α, remaining elements are ignored; if α is longer than β, β's fill is used for the remaining elements

> "abcdef"‼(10101▐1) ≡ "acef"
> "abcdef"‼0101010101 ≡ "bdf"
α's fill is kept for the resulting list. negative elements in β indicate that the fill element will be duplicated instead

> 12345▐0‼12_34 ≡ 1220004444▐0
Replicate also works with nested lists in β, and it flattens the structure:

#x↔name Mutate
mutate a variable in any scope, by applying a function to it monadically. 
> :21→n *3↔n n ≡ :63
this is a statement, so the verb starts where the previous statement ends. this might not work like you might expect it to:
> 3N 4M *2↔n n ≡ 8
because the body of the statement includes ||Set Function||s, which are syntactically verbs:
> (3N4M*2)↔n n ≡ 8    ' 3─n4─m*2 returns 8
> 3→n 4→m *2↔n n ≡ 6  ' but this works
if there is nothing in the statement body, the variable will be removed from its scope.
> 3→n 4→m *2↔n n ≡ 6

#'A,'ab Escape
escapes are one way to write characters outside the ascii range (characters in the range 0x20 ` ` to 0x7E `~`, the ones that you almost certainly have in your keyboard). you will see the escapes in the documentation of each character.
there are more non-ascii characters than ascii characters in the codepage (256 − 95 = 161), so some characters need two character escape sequences. these start with a lowercase letter [`a`, `z`].
the characters with single character escape sequences are the following:
> !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`{|}~
> ‼╕☻¶÷·'╙╜↔±○¬•╧╣┘│├╞╟╠┤╡╢♪♫≤≡≥¿¡αβ¢♀♂ƒ◄►↕↨└∟▬■◘╨Θ♠↓♦╩√↑Φ¥φ╓╤╖→⌐┴╘┬╛≈
#'[ÇüéâäàåçêëèïîìÄÅÉ]ab Unicode Escape
Unicode Escapes are vemf's wacky way of allowing unicode text in source code while still using the vemf codepage internally.
the first character can be any of "ÇüéâäàåçêëèïîìÄÅÉ" (or 0x80-0x91), and it specifies the bits 16-21 of the unicode codepoint, or the ||plane number@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)|| (plus 128). the next two bytes encode the other two bytes of the codepoint.
though currently only planes 0, 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16 (`ÇüéâÄÅÉ`) are used, the whole range of unicode characters up to U+10FFFF is supported, except for the UTF-16 surrogates U+D800-U+DFFF.
for example, to encode the emoji 🐈, with codepoint `U+1F408`, use the characters `0x81 0xF4 0x08` or `'ü⌠◘`:
> "'ü⌠◘" ≡ "🐈"
most characters you care about are in the plane 0, or the Basic Multilingual Plane. they will always start with `'Ç`.
> "'Ç¤«" ≡ "®" ' U+00AE REGISTERED SIGN
> "'Ç"`" ≡ "≠" ' U+2260 NOT EQUAL TO
> "'é¤!" ≡ "𠀡" ' U+20021 CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-20021
> "'â►l" ≡ "𱁬" ' U+3106C CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-3106C
escaping characters that are in the vemf codepage correspond to just the characters:
> "'Ç♥╡" ≡ ♪`ε ' U+03B5 GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON
unicode characters outside of literals can be verbs, adverbs or nouns depending on the character. see more details in src/token.rs.

when the character after the colon is a decimal digit `[0-9]` or the negative sign `-`, it will be interpreted as a number (integer or floating point).

> :39 ≡ 3*Φ+9
> :256 ≡ 2^8
> :-3 ≡ _3
> :12:24:32/4 ≡ 368
this also supports decimals, with a decimal point `.` or ||scientific notation@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation|| using `e`:
> :43.21 ≡ :4321/:100
> :6.022e23 ≈ :6.022*(Φ^:23)
> :1.6605e−27 ≈ :1.6605/(Φ^:27)
> :0.01 ≡ 1/:100
> :1e-2 ≡ 1/:100
this syntax allows for `0x` `0b` `0o` `0s` `0z` `0n` for hexadecimal, binary, octal, senary, duodecimal, hexatrigesimal respectively. these use the digits `0-9` and `a-z` (always in lowercase):
> :0xff ≡ :255
> :0xdeadbeef ≡ :3735928559
> :-0nxyz ≡ :-44027
> :0x100000000 ≡ 2^:32
the syntax looks a bit like this:
> number := ":" "-"? (decimal | based)
> decimal := [0-9]+ ("." [0-9]*)? ("e" "-"? [0-9]+)?
> based := "0x" [0-9a-f]*
>        | "0b" [0-1]*

#{abc} Define Function
return a function that executes the statements inside the braces, returning a value and stopping once a ||Return|| statement is hit. a ||Return|| statement is implicit at the end of a function. this function will have a role of verb.
> {"Hello, World!"☻·}→sayhi 0:sayhi ≡ ■
> {6á▲◘}→roll 0:roll ?≡ 4
> {6á▲}→roll 0:roll ?≡ 4
some variables are set when calling a function: `α` ||Alpha|| is set to the left argument, `β` ||Beta|| is set to the right argument or ||None|| if not given, `ƒ` ||Self|| to the function being called, and `Σ` ||Arity|| to the number of arguments passed.
> {α+β/2}→avg 3:avg7 ≡ 5
the inside of a function creates a scope, and any variables created inside the scope will not be visible once the function returns.
> 123{α*2→double .double-1} ≡ 135
> 123{α*2→double .double-1}· .double ≡ ■
when a function is created, all of the variables that it references as a value will be captured (lexical scope). this capture is immutable; if you change the value of a capture, it will only be changed in that function's scope.
> 123→l{l,α↔l}→append 4:append· l ≡ 123
there are two ways of changing this, both equivalent: not referencing the value (as ||Mutate Statement|| can take a function), or deleting the capture. then it will look for an `l` in the caller scope (dynamic scope); the variable you reference must be in scope and there must not be any other variable with the same name in the same scope.
> 123→l{,α↔l}→append 4:append· l ≡ 1234
> 123→l{→l l,α↔l}→append 4:append· l ≡ 1234

#█4☺☻♥♦ Integer Literals
a convenient literal syntax for large integers by specifying their bytes. integer literals are length-prefixed: after the `█` there will be a digit from 1 to 8 that specifies the number of bytes of the integer. `░` ||Short Literal||s and `▒` ||Long Literal||s are equivalent to `█2` and `█3` respectively.
an example: `█3☻♥♦` is the number `131844`. the number after the `█` is 3, so it will read three bytes. those bytes are `☻` `♥` `♦`, which means the output will be 0x020304, or `2*256^2 + 3*256 + 4`, or 131844.
> █3☻♥♦ ≡ :131844
> █3☻♥♦ ≡ 2*(:256^2) + (3*:256) + 4
`▒` can also be used here:
> ▒☻♥♦ ≡ :131844
let's represent the number 123456789. we can either use the ||Base Encode|| function: 
> :123456789é:256 ≡ :7:91:205:21▐0
alternatively, get the raw ||Bits|| of the number, partition it into ||Chunks|| of 8 bits, and ||Decode Binary|| them:
> :123456789é♥8╕è ≡ :0:0:0:0:7:91:205:21
we can represent the bytes as a codepage string (see ||Format||):
>     :7:91:205:21ⁿ5☻·
> "•[═§"
if we try it out,
> █4•[═§ ≡ :123456789
byte literals support negative numbers as well, using the two's complement when the first byte is over 127. `░²²` is not `253*256 + 253` or 64009, it's `65536 - 64009` or −515.
> ░²² ≡ :-515
integers in vemf are represented with signed two's-complement integers, so this is the same as making all the other bytes 0xFF
> ░²²é♥8╕è ≡ :255:255:255:255:255:255:253:253
`█` is mostly useful when using large numbers. if your number happens to be a vemf constant or has a trivial computation, use that instead.

#2 Format
when this is called with a right argument, it will be interpreted in the following way:
- 0: format for printing (see ||Execution||)
- 1: default format
- 2: integer
- 3: Unicode character
- 4: Unicode string
- 5: codepage string
- 7: line-separated list
- 8: left-aligned list of lists
- 9: right-aligned list of lists
you can also use multiple of these in a list, like `ⁿ74` (line-separated list of strings)
`8` and `9` are useful for neatly formatted tables:

if α has a non-null fill, G is called to the fill as well:
> 01001▐0¬ ≡ 10110▐1
#2a1 Each
Each (along with its variants) is the main way of doing iteration in vemf. scalar functions (like ||Add|| or ||Minimum||) all use ||Conform||, which is similar to ||Each||, so all of this will apply to those functions as well.
> 123╕+456 ≡ 123+456
if both α and β are lists, pair the items up and call G between them.
> 123+456 ≡ (1+4)(2+5)(3+6)
> "abc"╕,"xyz" ≡ "ax""by""cz"
> 123*456 ≡ :4:10:18
if all non-scalar arguments have non-null fill, G is called with the fills as well:
> 0123▐0+1 ≡ 1234▐1
> 2315103▐4*(1021100▐2) ≡ 2025100▐8
when two lists have different lengths, the shorter list will use its fill to fill up the missing elements:

> 567▐1+01234 ≡ 57945
> 567▐1+01234 ≡ 57945
if any argument is a scalar, it will be copied in each iteration (or equivalently, it is extended to the other argument's shape):
> 123╕,0 ≡ │10│20│30
> 1234╕{αⁿ;`#} ≡ "#1""#2""#3""#4"
> 1234ª╕(;`#) ≡ "#1""#2""#3""#4"
> 1234ª╕;`# ≡ "#1""#2""#3""#4"
if both arguments are scalars, it just applies the operation on them
> 1╕,2 ≡ 12
if any of the arguments is a function, it treats it as an infinite list, composing the operation to it:
> .◄+1↑Φ ≡ 123456789Φ
> .◄*(ó2)↑Φ ≡ 0020406080
Each applies only to one level of nesting, unlike ||Conform||:

> 0123456789(681942)╔▼ ≡ 0013355778
if the result list from G is shorter than `αF`, the last indices will be removed from the list:
> "big brown fox"(4↕9)╔"blue" ≡ "big blue fox"
> 0248Φ(124)╔φ ≡ 08
and if the result list from G is longer than `αF`, the last values will be inserted after the last one:
> "big brown fox"(4↕9)╔(‼2) ≡ "big bbrroowwnn fox"

#α─name Set Function
set a local variable `.name` to the value α. similar to `→name` ||Set|| but acts as a function.
> 2─two· .two+.two ≡ 4
after setting, it returns α. you can assign a function and use it right after:
> 2─two+.two ≡ 4
the uppercase ascii letters `A` `B` `C`... are assigned to be `─a` `─b` `─c` by default. this makes for a very convenient way of setting and querying variables:
> 2T+t ≡ 4  ' αT sets α to the variable `t` and returns α
this function is special in that, when used as a verb and called with two arguments, the right argument will be interpreted after the variable is set. this allows for code like this:
> 1A 2B (ab)+ ≡ 3
even if `(ab)` is an argument of `B`, and would logically other functions evaluate their arguments before calling them.
#α─nameβ Set Function
sets a variable to α in the local scope and returns β.
> 1─a2─b3─c a+b+c ≡ 6
> 1A2B3C +a+b ≡ 6
